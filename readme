1. Install docker using one of the following links
	a. [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
	b. [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
	c. [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

Using linux:
	sudo docker run hello-world
	git pull 
	cd tester
	sudo docker-compose up -d --build 	-> builds, creates (or recreates), starts, 
						   and detaches the containers (-d for detach)
	sudo docker compose ps 			-> to confirm

	Access - Port 80			-> you will know it's working when it displays a message.

When you're finished:
	docker-compose stop 			-> from the same folder
